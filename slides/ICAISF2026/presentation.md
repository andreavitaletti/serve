# The Need for Seed Diversity

- Over 50,000 edible plants exist worldwide, but **just 15 provide 90% of food energy intake** (e.g., rice, corn, wheat).
- More than 95% of crop **genetic erosion** articles report changes in diversity, with nearly 80% showing evidence of loss [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17733).

# Conservation Strategies

| Criteria | In Situ Conservation | Ex Situ Conservation |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Location** | Natural environment / farms | Seed banks, seed vaults |
| **Evolution** | Plants adapt naturally | Static; no natural evolution |
| **Risk of Loss**| Higher (climate, land-use) | Lower (controlled conditions) |
| **Access** | Local and informal | Global access via formal mechanisms |
| **Cost** | Lower short-term cost | Higher cost (infrastructure) |
| **Best Use** | Wild relatives, landraces | Major crops, backup |

# Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV)

- A global backup facility for seed banks worldwide.
- Safeguards over 1.2 million samples representing >6,000 plant species.
- Unanimously considered the **backup seed facility that provides the highest standards of safety and security.**

# Open Problem

- The vast majority of species, mostly CWR in the SGSV, have only a **single depositor** [[2]](https://seedvault.nordgen.org/Search).
- **The Threat:** if a disaster hits both the primary seed bank and the vault, the species could be lost.

# Orthodox Seeds and Storage

- **Orthodox Seeds:** Approximately 90% of species can retain viability if dried and kept at low temperatures (e.g., wheat, rice, legumes).
- **Storage Standards:** FAO recommends [[3]](https://doi.org/10.4060/cc0021en) long-term storage at **-18°C and 15% relative humidity.**
- Subzero freezers are acceptable if ideal conditions are not available.

# Collective Seed Storage (CSS)

- **Domestic freezers provide suitable conditions for seed conservation** 
- **Vision:** Each household becomes a micro-node in a distributed seed conservation system. Citizens are active contributors to food system resilience and biodiversity conservation
- **Shared Economy Approach:** Sharing a tiny, idle portion of home freezers for seed preservation, to drastically increase redundancy and the overall availability of seeds with minimal infrastructure investments.

# CSS Requirements

To ensure feasibility and active participation, the system must meet:

1. **Storage Standards (R1):** FAO long-term storage conditions (approx. -18°C). Subzero acceptable.
2. **User-Friendly (R2):** Simple installation using off-the-shelf equipment and home WiFi.
3. **Longevity (R3):** Operate for at least 1 year without user intervention (battery life).
4. **Incentivization (R4):** Implement mechanisms to reward users for their long-term commitment.

# R1: Storage

<!--
- **Experiment:** Monitoring a Bosch domestic freezer set to -18°C.
- **Results:** Subzero conditions are easily met, though temperature fluctuates (as per acceptable secondary standards).

# Conclusions

- CSS can support the preservation of seed diversity by transforming urban citizens into "active" agents of agricultural resilience: households become micro-nodes within a distributed seed conservation system
- Our Proof-of-Concept demonstrates the feasibility of the core technical components underlying this vision.

# Discussion

- A modern approach to seed preservation should promote <u>more active citizen participation</u> (e.g., Seed Guardians) that extends beyond the mere act of storage.
-  Although the preservation of seeds in domestic freezers is a novel and valuable practice, it may remain, to some extent, a "passive" activity.
