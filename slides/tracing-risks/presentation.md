# Context: COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps

<div class="warn">

<i class="fa-solid fa-key"></i> Studies suggest the employment of Contact Tracing Apps for epidemic control of COVID-19 


</div>

E.g. [Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests epidemic control with digital contact tracing](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb6936)

# Context: COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps

- Governments planned mobile apps to **alert people exposed to COVID-19 patients**
- Guiding promise: *privacy-respecting* design using Bluetooth pseudonyms
- Active debate between researchers on **centralised vs. decentralised** approaches

<div class="warn">

### ⚠️ Goal
Clarify what a tracking app **could and could not** guarantee — regardless of its technical implementation

</div>

--- 

# Summary of Claims vs. Reality

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| No patient-name database | **TRUE** |
| Data is anonymous | **FALSE** |
| Impossible to find out who infected whom | **FALSE** |
| Impossible to know if a specific person is sick | **FALSE** |
| Impossible to trigger a false alarm | **FALSE** |
| Bluetooth is not a security issue | **FALSE** |
| The system makes large-scale snooping impossible | **FALSE** |

---

# How the App Works

- Each phone **generates a random pseudonym** every ~5 minutes
- Phones in proximity **exchange pseudonyms via Bluetooth** and record the time
- Data stored locally for **14 days**
- If **Alice tests positive** → app alerts all contacts (e.g. Bob) who received her pseudonyms

# How Bob is informed

<div class="box">

### :gear: The Models

- **Decentralised** (DP3T, Apple/Google): **Alice's pseudonyms are published publicly** (e.g. p2p, bulletin board); Bob checks locally.
- **Centralised** (ROBERT): **Alice's contacts pseudonym (BoB included) are sent to a server**; The server informs BoB.

# Data is NOT Anonymous

- Records are **pseudonymised**, not anonymous — a critical distinction under the [GDPR(Article 4(5))](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/):

- De-anonymisation possible via: **Bluetooth antenna**, **IP address**, or **cross-referencing contacts**

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Nominative | Mr. Bloggs is sick |
| Pseudonymous | Pseudonym 439Hxs is sick |
| Truly anonymous | There are 50,437 cases |

# How to Find Out Who Infected You

Even without technical skills, users can infer identities:

<div class="scenario">

**Scenario: The Sole Suspect** — Mr. Smith never leaves home except to shop at the neighbourhood grocery. He receives a notification. Only one person can be responsible: the grocer.

</div>

<div class="scenario">

**Scenario: Information Crossing** — Mrs. Jones receives a notification and chats with neighbours (notif.) and colleagues ($\neg$ notif.). She narrows the source to Mr. Attrisk on the 3rd floor and posts her suspicion on social networks.

</div>

> These scenarios require **no hacking skills** — only social deduction.

---

# How to Find Out Who Infected You

Even without technical skills, users can infer identities:

<div class="scenario">

**Scenario: Are my neighbours sick?** — Mr. Hipokondriac would like to know if his
neighbours are sick. He ﬁnds his old telephone in a cupboard, installs the TraceVIRUS
app, and leaves it in his mailbox at the bottom of his building. All of the neighbours
pass by each time they return home, and the phone will receive a notiﬁcation if one of
them is sick.

</div>

> These scenarios require **no hacking skills** — only social deduction.

---

# How do you know if a speciﬁc person is sick?

Any tracking system that notifies contacts **can be used to monitor a specific person**:

1. Use a **dedicated phone** registered only with the target
2. Keep the phone near the target during an interaction
3. Receive an alert if the target later tests positive

<div class="scenario">

**Scenario: The Job Interview** — The KROOKS company uses a dedicated phone only during the interview. They will be notified if the candidate later tests positive — giving them discriminatory medical information.

</div>

# False Alarms Are Easy to Trigger

<div class="scenario">

**Scenario: The Anti-System Activist** — Mr. Spart ties his phone to his dog and lets it run in the park all day. He then tests positive, and all dog walkers receive a COVID notification.

</div>

<div class="scenario">

**Scenario: The Pupil Bart Symptomson** — Bart borrows a sick person's phone, passes it around his classroom and staffroom. The sick person tests positive → the whole school is forced to close.

</div>

<div class="warn">

### :warning: Impact
False alarms can **target individuals** (athletes, job candidates, negotiators) or **disable entire systems** at scale.

</div>

# Bluetooth Itself Is a Security Risk

- Bluetooth was **not designed to test physical proximity** (e.g. detects through walls)
- Activating Bluetooth opens **known security vulnerabilities** (e.g. Blueborne, 2017)
- Bluetooth signals can be **captured from over 1 km** with a directional antenna

<div class="scenario">

**Scenario: Burglary** — Ms. Beagle scans for Bluetooth signals before entering Uncle Duck's house. No signal = house is empty.

</div>

<div class="scenario">

**Scenario: Mall Surveillance** — A shopping centre uses a Bluetooth antenna at the entrance to detect which customers are running the tracing app.

</div>

# [WhisperPair](https://whisperpair.eu/)

- **Bluetooth hijacking** Google Fast Pair not correctly implemented $\rightarrow$  attacker can forcefully pair with a vulnerable bluetooth accessory /record audio, pump up volume).
- **Location tracking** Using [Google's Find Hub Network](https://www.google.com/android/find/)

![bg right:30% fit](assets/images/presentation-20260520-095443.png)

---

# Towards Large-Scale Snooping

Even without official access, third parties can build shadow registries:

- **By users:** A companion app (GeoTraceVIRUS) pairs GPS coordinates with Bluetooth pseudonyms, revealing where sick patients were.
- **By data companies:** Retailers already use in-store Bluetooth tracking; linking it with tracing pseudonyms creates a private list of sick customers.
- **By cyber criminals:** Malware can blackmail users who declare a positive test, or sell "infect your neighbour" services.

<div class="warn">

In Decentralised solution, ids are public $\leftarrow$ easier re-identification

</div>

---

# Towards Large-Scale Snooping

<div class="warn">

### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Key Insight
Most attacks exploit **features** of these systems, not bugs — they cannot be fixed by better cryptography alone.

</div>



---

# Conclusions

- These risks are **inherent in how contact tracing works**, not just implementation details
- Cryptography can only address a **limited subset** of these threats
- The scenarios presented are **known, plausible, and easy to execute**

<div class="box">

### :balance_scale: The Core Trade-off
The benefits of digital tracing remain **highly uncertain**, while the privacy and security harms are **concrete and foreseeable**. Political choices — not technology — must weigh these.

</div>

> "Asking people to choose between privacy and health is, in fact, the very root of the problem. Because this is a false choice. We can and should enjoy both privacy and health. We can choose to protect our health and stop the coronavirus epidemic not by instituting totalitarian surveillance regimes, but rather by empowering citizens."

# Discussion

- Should society deploy systems with **known, unavoidable privacy risks** for epidemiological benefits that remain uncertain?
- Who bears responsibility when tracing is **misused by employers, insurers, or criminals**?
- How do we balance **collective health protection** with **individual rights** in a surveillance-capable society?
